what is Binding?

resolving function call with function body is called as Binding.

how many types of Binding are there?

2 types: early binding and late binding

	early binding means resolving function call with function body at the compilation time.
	In Java early binding happens when a function is "private" or "static" or "final".

	late binding means resolving function call with function body at the runtime.
	for the methods other than "private" or "static" or "final" we have always late binding in java.
