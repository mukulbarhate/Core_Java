imp. points about object cloning in java


java.lang.Object class has 

	protected Object clone()throws CloneNotSupportedException

method

if you need to clone object of a particular class, that class has to

a) implement "Cloneable" interface
	[ Cloneable interface does not have any abstract method. It's a marker interface ]
b) override "clone()" method of Object class.
