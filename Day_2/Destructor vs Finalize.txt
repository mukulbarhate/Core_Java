	instance members of m1
	destructor can be used to release system resources if any.



		  Java
main()
{
	MyClass m1=new MyClass();  // a) memory allocation  b) constructor


}// when scope of m1 is over, the object to which m1 was referring to , gets garbage collected
	and just before that "finalize()" method gets called.

	"finalize() method" can be used to release system resources if any.
