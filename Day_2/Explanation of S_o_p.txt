System.out.println("hello");

	a) "hello" needs to be displayed

	b) u need to invoke "print()" or "println()" methods
		println("hello");

	c) both the methods are non-static in "PrintStream" class , so you need reference of "PrintStream" class
		
	d) "out" is a reference of "PrintStream" 

		out.println("hello")


	e) "out" is also a static member of "System" class which can be accessed as "classname.member" i.e.
		System.out.println("hello");
