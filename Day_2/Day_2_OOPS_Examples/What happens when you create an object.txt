What happens when you create an object?

what happens when object is created.

a) memory is allocated for instance member/s.
b) members are implicitly initialized with default values e.g primitives like int,short etc  as 0 , boolean as false, reference types as null.  If programmer has done any explicit initialization, members are initialized.
c) constructor is called and if programmer has done any explicit initialization inside it, members are initialized accordingly.



what is constructor?

ans:
	Constructor is a "special member function". It is special because
	a) it has same name that of class
	b) it cannot have a return type as it is not expected to return anything.
	c) it is invoked implicitly when you create an object

There are 2 types of constructors in Java:

a) default or no-arg constructor - it doesn't have any argument
	e.g.  Account()
	      {
	      }

b) parameterized constructor- it has atleast one argument
	e.g  Account(int id,String name,double balance)
	     {
	     }


What is the concept of default or no-arg constructor?

ans:-  when we don't define any constructor inside the class, compiler provides "default or no-arg constructor".
But the moment we define any constructor , compiler does not interfere ( it does not provide default or no-arg constructor)
