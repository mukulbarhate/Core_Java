1) download "jdeserialize-1.2.jar" 
2) store it inside the folder from where you would like to check the content of the generated file in case of serialization.

3) go to the folder where you would like to check the content of the generated file and give following command on the command prompt

java -jar jdeserialize-1.2.jar e:\\my.ser

here it is assumed that "my.ser" is the file in which object is serialized and it is located in "e:\\" drive.
