package

package is a collection of related classes and interfaces.

package is mainly used to avoid name conflicts.
package concept is similar to "namespace" concept of C++.

java has so many in-built packages . e.g.

java.awt
java.io
java.util
java.lang
and so on

by def. java.lang is available to all the java applications.

in order to use package u need to use the keyword "import".

when u say "import", nothing is physically included ( unlike #include of c and c++ ). It is only for compiler. Runtime performance is not at all affected with "import" statements.
