show(Object ref)
{
	S.o.p(ref);
}



we can call this show() function as follows:
	
	int num=100;
	show(num);  // it's possible from jdk5 onwards

how it's possible?

when you say 
	show(num);

what compiler does ?
	show(new Integer(num));

i.e. compile does autoboxing ( converts int to Integer ) and pass that Integer to the method which has "Object" as a parameter.
