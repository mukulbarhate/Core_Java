In traditional programming, error detection, reporting, and handling often lead to confusing  code because programmers would use error code inside the main logic.
Exceptions are readable e.g. FileNotFoundException,ClassNotFoundException,NullPointerException etc.

A second advantage of exceptions is the ability to propagate error reporting up the call stack of methods. i.e. if a method does not want to handle an exception it can propagate it to the caller and so on. we did not have this advantage in traditional programming.

Thid advantage is, because all exceptions thrown within a program are objects, the grouping or categorizing of exceptions is a natural outcome of the class hierarchy.
