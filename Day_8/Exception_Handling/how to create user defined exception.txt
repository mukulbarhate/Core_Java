how to create user defined exception?
	checked exception or unchecked exception

for checked exception:

	public class MyException extends Exception{}

for unchecked exception:

	public class MyException extends RuntimeException{}


on what basis you will decide whether to create checked or unchecked exception?

you create checked exception when you would like your client to take corrective action/s in case of exception.  i.e. checked exception somehow enforces client to handle it. (using try...catch) and the corrective action/s can be taken inside catch block.

you create unchecked exception when you feel there is no need of any corrective action by client in case of exception.
