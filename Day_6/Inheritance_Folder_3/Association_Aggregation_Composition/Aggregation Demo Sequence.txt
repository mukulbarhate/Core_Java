1) Department class gets instantiated and its members are allocated memory.
2) "md" reference is created on the stack.
3) "md" refers to the instance of Department inside heap.
4) Teacher class gets instantiated and its members are allocated memory.
5) "t1" reference is created on the stack.
6) "t1" refers to the instance of Teacher inside heap.
7) when "addTeacher()" method gets called,"teacher" reference of Teacher class inside the instance of Department refers to the Teacher instance on the heap.
8) we say "md=null" inside the application.
9) Department instance on the heap is marked for GC.
10) That does not affect Teacher instance available on heap because it is still referenced by "t1" reference on the stack.
