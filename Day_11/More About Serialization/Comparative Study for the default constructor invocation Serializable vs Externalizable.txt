why in case of Serializable "default constructor" does not get called during deserialization?

ans -  Because if here default constructor gets called then we will get default values and not those values which were there when we stored that object inside filesystem.


But then why default constructor gets called in case of Externalizable ?

ans- It is true that default constructor gives us default initial values, But Externalizable gives us one more chance to reinitialize our members with the help of file info ie. using "readExternal()" method.
