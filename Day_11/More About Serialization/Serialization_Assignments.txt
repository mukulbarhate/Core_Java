1)create a customer class with following attributes
	custid
	custname
	address
	age
create one instance of it and store it in a file. (Serialization).
now open a file, read the object and read its contents . (Deserialization)




2) Person class implements Serializable with
	private String name
	private int age

		getters and setters
		parameterized constructor

Student extends Person
	private int rollno
		getter and setters
		parameterized constructor accepting name,age and rollno
			pass name and age to the super constructor


Demo class with main
	create one object of Student, write it inside file and then read.

3) Define a class "Student" with
	private int rollno and private String name and private int age;
	setters and getters

	create 2 objects of Student and write them inside filesystem and thereafter read both the objects and display.

4) create two classes
	Engine
		private int speed
		private String type
			setters and getters

	Car
		private Engine engine;
		private String modelname;
			setters and getters

define class "Demo" with main
	inside main create object of Car and then pass Engine to its setEngine method.
	now serialize this object of Car and deserialize it.

5) create a class "Student" with
	int rollno, String name, String qualification,String hobbies,String bloodgroup,String emailid
		setters,getters

define a class "Demo" with main.
inside main function create one object of student and then while serializing and deserializing make sure u store and retrieve only rollno,name and qualification of student. [ use Externalizable ]
