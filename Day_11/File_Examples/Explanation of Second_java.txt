FileOutputStream fos=new FileOutputStream("d:\\abc1.txt",true)
	above statement will create a file if file does not exist.
	argument "true" inside FileOutputStream constructor indicates that if file exists then it will get appended.
		
	byte b[]=new byte[100];
		byte array is created so that user input can be stored inside it.
	
	int k=System.in.read(b);
		we accept input from user inside "b" which is byte array.
	here "k" will hold number of bytes read.
	
	fos.write(b,0,k);
		here we write user input stored inside byte array to file.
	write has 3 arguments:
		1) byte array to be written
		2) it should start with 0
		3) how many exact no. of bytes we would like to write inside file.
