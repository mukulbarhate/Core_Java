when we create object of child class 
	control goes to child class constructor

	from there it will invoke parent class default/no-arg constructor by default.
	and then it comes back inside child class constructor.


what if parent class does not have "default/no-arg" constructor?

	By default we get an error.

How do we solve this problem?

	a) we can provide "default/no-arg" constructor inside parent class
		or
	b) invoke parameterized constructor of parent class from child class ( using "super")
