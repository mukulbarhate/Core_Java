Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. A few Java recursion examples are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.


Example 1:


package core1;

public class Main {
	
	static int factorial(int k)
	{
		if(k==1)
		{
			return 1;
		}
		else
		{
			return k*factorial(k-1);
		}
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		System.out.println(factorial(5));
	}
}
