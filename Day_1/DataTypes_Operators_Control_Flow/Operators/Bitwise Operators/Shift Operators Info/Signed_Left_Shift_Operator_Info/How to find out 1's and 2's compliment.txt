given binary representation is

11010110

its 1's compliment ( convert 1 to 0 and 0 to 1) would be

00101001


now in order to find out 2's compliment
	first step is to convert it into 1's compliment
		i.e.
		00101001
	add 1 to it. So,
		00101001
	      +	       1

in binary 1+1 is 0 ,  
	   0+1 is 1

so in the above addition result 

	00101001
      +        1
	       
from the right side,
	1+1  is  0
	1 gets carried to second last element i.e. 0
		0+1  is 1
	and then other digits remain as it is. Hence the result is
	
00101010  [ is the 2's compliment of above binary representation]
