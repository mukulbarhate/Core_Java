Suppose number given is -5

How will you calculate its binary number?

first forget the sign i.e. - (minus)

second find out the binary of 5 
	that comes to

			0000000000000101


now find out 1's complement of the above binary number ( you just have to flip the digits)

so, 1's complement of the above binary number is :

1111111111111010   [ u just have to flip 1 to 0 and vice-versa ]


now find out 2's complement of above number ( you just have to add 1 to it). This 2's complement is nothing but binary of -5


1111111111111010
+	       1

1111111111111011		2's complement of binary of 5 which is nothing but binary of -5



Note: when we add 1 and 0 , result is 1
