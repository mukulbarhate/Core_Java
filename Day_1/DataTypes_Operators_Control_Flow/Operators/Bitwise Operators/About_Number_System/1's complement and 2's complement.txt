suppose the binary no. is

100010

First way:

in order to find out 1's complement, you have to flip 1 to 0 and 0 to 1

011101   [ 1's complement of above binary ]

in order to find out 2's complement, you have to add 1 to the above 1's complement representation

011101
+    1

here 1+1 is 2 
	how 2 is represented in the binary?
		1 0

so on right side you have   1  0

write  1  0 on the right side and then remaining digits as it is.

011110  [ 2's complement of above binary i.e. 100010]


Second way:


the target binary is

100010

now start from right side and write the digits as it is till you get first  1  and there after flip [ 1 to 0 and vice-versa ]

so, start from the extreme right we have 0
	write 0
	then we have first 1 
	write 1  [ as it is]
now since first 1 is encountered , remaining digits need to be flipped.

so  

011110  [ 2's complement of above binary]
