The ability for a new class to be created from an existing class by extending it is known as inheritance. It provides reusability. Basically you go for inheritance when u realize that "new type is same as existing type". 

e.g.

class Person
{
	private String name,address;
	private int age;

	// setters and getters
}

now we can derive "Student" class from Person.

class Student extends Person
{
	private String qualification;
	private int rollno,ccppid;

	//setters and getters
}

	Here Student can inherit "name","address" and "age" from "Person" class.


Java allows only 3 types of inheritance
a) single level  b) multi-level  c) Hierarchical

Inheritance is inbuilt in java i.e. if your class is not derived from any base class, "java.lang.Object" is the base class of it.
