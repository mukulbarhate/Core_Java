In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects communicate with each other by sending messages. This is typically achieved through method calls, where one object invokes a method on another object to request some action or information. 
e.g.

Student object can communicate Course object in order to find out course name,duration and fees whereas Course object can communicate with Student in order to find out his qualification.
